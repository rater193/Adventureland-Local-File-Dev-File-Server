# How to edit your code?
- The default file that gets ran without configuring the Client.js source, is inside `"client/startup.js"`.
- There you will find a full example of how it works and how to use other libraries
- I also included some of my own personal bot code you can reference as well
 - `"client/basicAttack.js"`
 - `"client/RatMage.js"`
 - `"client/RatRanger.js"`
 - `"client/RatRanger2.js"`
